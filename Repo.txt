Practical Task 3

•	  Pick any one of your GitHub repos.
•	  Create 2 issues for things you think could be improved. Ideas for improvements include making new methods, adding constants, renaming variables and functions, or adding comments.
•	  For each issue:
•	  Create a branch with a meaningful name.
•	  Implement the changes required by the issue.
•	  Commit and push your work.
•	  Create a PR for your changes.
•	  Merge in the PR and close the issue.
•	  In a text file called repo.txt, paste the link to your repo. Add the file to this task's folder.

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to fulfill your request:

1. Choose a GitHub repository: Choose one of your repositories where you want to create the issues for improvement.

2. Create 2 issues: Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository and create two new issues describing things you think could be improved. Ideas for improvements could include adding new methods, constants, renaming variables/functions, or adding comments.

3. For each issue:
   - Create a branch: Create a new branch with a meaningful name related to the issue you're working on.
   - Implement changes: Make the necessary changes to address the issue.
   - Commit and push: Commit your changes locally and push them to the branch you created on GitHub.
   - Create a PR: Create a pull request (PR) for your changes. Reference the issue in the PR description.
   - Merge and close: After reviewing the changes, merge the PR into the main branch and close the associated issue.

4. Create a text file called repo.txt: Open a text editor, paste the link to your repository, and save the file. Add this file to the task's folder.

Here's an example of how to do this using command-line Git commands:

# Step 1: Choose a GitHub repository and clone it
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

# Step 2: Create 2 issues on GitHub
# Go to your repository on GitHub and create two new issues describing improvement
# Step 3: For each issue
# Issue 1
git checkout -b issue1_new_method
# Implement changes
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented new method to address issue #1"
# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin issue1_new_method
# Create a PR on GitHub and merge it
# Close the issue on GitHub

# Issue 2
git checkout -b issue2_rename_variables
# Implement changes
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Renamed variables to improve clarity for issue #2"
# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin issue2_rename_variables
# Create a PR on GitHub and merge it
# Close the issue on GitHub

# Step 4: Create a text file with the repository link
echo "Repository link: <repository_url>" > repo.txt
# Add the file to the task's folder
mv repo.txt <task_folder_path>

I have replaced `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository and `<task_folder_path>` with the path to the folder for this task.
